HTML

What I put:
p, b and i when necessary, q erasing the quotes in the text, otherwise there are two couples of quotes, I thought with qit is labeled and easier for what we have to do next, h1 and h3 for the dimensions of headers, footer for that special kind of footnote I found in the original article, img src="xxx.jpg for images because FOR NOW they are in the same folder, but I don't think they will when we put the website together (for now, let's leave it like this)
title as the website shows


doubt: credit to the photographer is just paragraph, but maybe later on we will have to put IDs for this kind of things

ADJUSTMENTS I MADE ON "JAPAN" FOR MY THEME:

This is the Japan article from delfina that I changed in order to fit my theme (and not mess up w/yours):

what I changed:
- div class= bg for images, in case one wants to apply any sort of non-predefined filter on their images
- added time and author for styling
- span id on the first two chars of the date in order to make it fancier on my theme

NOTE: all of these changes/classes WILL NOT affect your theme, unless you use the specific classes
