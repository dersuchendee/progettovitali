ADJUSTMENTS I MADEON HTML FOR MY THEME:

This is the Japan article from delfina that I changed in order to fit my theme (and not mess up w/yours):

what I changed:
- div class= bg for images, in case one wants to apply any sort of non-predefined filter on their images
- added time and author for styling
- span id on the first two chars of the date in order to make it fancier on my theme
- included a link to my jquery script
- included CDN jquery documentation link on the head (required)
- included buttons so my script will work. To hide them, use display:none; on css

NOTE: all of these changes/classes WILL NOT affect your theme, unless you use the specific classes
