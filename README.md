HTML

What I put:
<p, <b and <i when necessary, <q erasing the quotes in the text, otherwise there are two couples of quotes, I thought with <q it is labeled and easier for what we have to do next, <h1 and <h3 for the dimensions of headers, <footer for that special kind of footnote I found in the original article, <img src="xxx.jpg" for images because FOR NOW they are in the same folder, but I don't think they will when we put the website together (for now, let's leave it like this)
<title as the website shows
doubt: credit to the photographer is <p>, but maybe later on we will have to put IDs for this kind of things
